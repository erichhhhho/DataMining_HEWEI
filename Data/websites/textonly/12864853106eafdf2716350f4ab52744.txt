	With goal of reducing air pollution caused by cars, the city of Hengshui in northern China's Hebei province has decided to offer citizens free bus service during the coming winter. Citizens will enjoy complimentary bus rides on 26 routes from Nov. 15, 2016 to March 15, 2017.

	According to the plan, the city's bus company will put all buses into operation to shorten wait times. During peak hours, staff members will be on hand to guide passengers on and off the bus at key stops. An intelligent dispatch system will be used to monitor the buses, keeping a close eye on passenger flow in order to ensure convenient and prompt service.
