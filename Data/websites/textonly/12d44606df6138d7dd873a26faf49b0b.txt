'Ugly and unsuccessful' man who amazed millions with his gorgeous Ukrainian wife sets up international dating club to help Asian bachelors find pretty European girlfriends
An entrepreneur has set up a dating club to help 'exceptional' bachelors from the Far East find Ukrainian girlfriends through monthly speed-dating events.
Mei Aisi, his wife and their daughter are on holiday. Mr Mei became famous in China after sharing pictures of his Ukrainian wife. People in China were amazed by his pretty partner
Mr Mei told MailOnline: 'Chinese people couldn't believe a guy as ugly and academically unsuccessful as me could have a gorgeous wife like that.' He has set up a dating agency to help bachelors from the Far East look for East European wives through speed-dating events
The businessman's daily posts about his wife and their daughter, Alice Mei, have made him some sort of a celebrity.
Mr Mei's wife, 23-year-old Daria, is a professional opera singer and 12 years his junior. She is tall, blonde and a typical beauty in the eyes of Chinese people.
Mr Mei told MailOnline that he decided to set up Ulove club after many men in China started asking him how they could find a wife as beautiful as his. Before that, he had already had a trading company and a bronze valve factory in Ukraine.
Mr Mei became famous in China after he started posting pictures of his wife, who is an opera singer, on his social media account. He said people couldn't believe his wife is so pretty
'Compared to Ukrainian men, Chinese men are better husbands,' said Mei Aisi, who referred to Ukraine as 'a land of beauties'.
'Ukrainian men often have male chauvinism. They drink a lot and some might beat their wives. This happened to my wife's sister.
Based in Kharkiv, the second largest city of Ukraine, Ulove is a match-making agency that connects talented Ukrainian women with exceptional Chinese men, according to Mr Mei.
Female candidates as young as 17 wear glamorous makeup and evening dresses at the monthly speed-dating event to attract successful single men who travel from China to Ukraine especially in hope of finding a pretty European wife. 
Looking for Mr Right: Female candidates blow kisses to the camera as they attend a speed-dating event organised by Ulove in Kharkiv, Ukraine, to meet successful Chinese bachelors
Dress to impress: The female members, who are 20 years old in average, wear glamorous makeup and evening dresses while the male members travel from China especially
Good times: Male and female members at the Ulove club dance together during a speed-dating event held at a luxurious golf club in Kharkiv, a largely-Russian speaking city
Deep-pocketed bachelors first pay a 96,000 yuan (£11,000) annual membership fee - or 300,000 yuan (£34,600) as VIPs - before spending an extra 69,000 yuan (£8,000) on each dating event held at a luxurious golf club in Kharkiv. 
Mr Mei, the father of a three-year-old girl, confessed that a few male members, though wealthy,  don't have much taste and don't know how to woo women. 
One of the female members told a reporter from Arrow Factory that she wants to find a partner through the club with whom she could travel the world and have a lot of children
Two Ukrainian women, who are a set of twins, told the reporter from Arrow Factory that they really like Chinese men because they are generous, considerate and adorable
A third female member wanted to tell the reporter in Mandarin that she hopes to visit the Great Wall of China. But what she said means 'I'm going to build the Great Wall'
On Ulove's account on Weibo, China's most popular social media app, female members hold signboards with Chinese characters  to advertise themselves to eligible bachelors.
Some of the romantic messages read 'would you like to have a cute Eurasian baby' and 'I'm learning Chinese hard so that I can treat your ears with sweet words'.
Ulove's female members hold signboards as advertisement as they appear on the club's official account on Chinese social media. The woman on the left says she wishes to sing for her other half and teach him to dance; while the one on the right says she's studying Mandarin hard
Apparently, the Ukrainian women are also learning about Chinese culture in order to better communicate with their future partners. One woman (left) holds a signboard which says she's learning to cook Chinese food while the other (right) she likes Chinese people's obedience
Kharkiv-born Karalina, 21, who found a Chinese boyfriend through the cub told MailOnline that compared to Ukrainian men, Chinese men are more caring.
She said: 'In their culture, family comes first. Their temperament is gentle and they are willing to spend more time with their girlfriend.'
Karalina, who joined Ulove at the end of 2016, started dating Li Kefu, 35, after meeting the Chinese entrepreneur at a speed-dating event in May.    
Mr Li, who is from Shaanxi Province, China, said European women are more out-going and innocent - compared to Chinese women. He said he had worked in Europe for a long time before and was in Ukraine studying when he got to know Karalina.
Lucky man: Li Kefu, a 35-year-old entrepreneur from China, found a 21-year-old girlfriend through the Ulove club in June. Mr Li said European women are out-going and innocent
Mr Li and his girlfriend, Karalina, met at a speed-dating event in Kharkiv in May. Mr Li said He said he had worked in Europe for a long time before and was in Ukraine studying at the time
'If we use the soaring property price at China's first-tier cities as a benchmark, the membership fee at Ulove is only the cost of a kitchen. It's definitely worth spending (the amount) to find the love of my life,' Mr Li told MailOnline.
'Sometimes, love is a matter of the expression in the eyes, a hand gesture or a simplest word,' he explained, adding that he's learning Russian and Karalina is learning Mandarin.
Ulove Club is founded by Mei Aisi, 35, a Chinese man who has lived in Ukraine for 16 years. Mr Mei said he set up the club after many Chinese men asked him how to find a European wife
Mr Mei said Ukrainian women marry young and most of Ulove's female members are around 20 years old and university students. Above are two members, Kate (left) and Hanna (right)
Above are two posters on Ulove's social media account featuring its female members. The posters invite male members to embark on 'a journey of love to Ukraine' on September 25
Mr Mei said Ulove Club currently has around 75 male members, who are mainly middle-class businessmen from major Chinese cities, and more than 300 female members, who are all Ukrainian. 
Because women in Ukraine tend to marry early - usually before 23 years old - the club's female members are young, said Mr Mei. 
Since its establishment in December, 2016, So far, the club has organised 10 speed dating events and successfully connected more than 20 couples. 
Looking into the future, Mr Mei said he hopes to expand his international match-making business to neighbouring countries, such as Belarus and Russia. 
He said: 'Some people have accused our club as a human trafficking ring or even international prostitution group. I want to stress that this is definitely not the case.
