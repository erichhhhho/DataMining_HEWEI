What Manchu resources. Books, audiovisual foremost, but also curious about presential classes or tutors, if only for reference
Google maps bicycle routes doesn't work for China so I use the walking routes instead to get a best route instead, but sometimes it tells me to use the G roads, are these accessible by bike? I've tried maps.me but their info is out of date compared to google and baidu and baidus cycling route is also sending me on a G road
Highways are a no no. You also  should  keep away from national roads. Use Amap, Amap has a  bicycle function.  
That really depends on the location. West of the Tengchong Hehei line, national roads (G214, G318, etc) are quite popular with Chinese cyclists.
Some S roads are OK, others are highways. Most highways will have a a sign to indicate that you can't get on them.
