Two university departments dedicated to the president’s philosophy have been created while ‘study groups’ are being promoted across the country 
Cai Qi, a Xi ally who is Beijing’s Communist party chief and was this week promoted into China’s 25-member politburo, said “studying, promoting and implementing the spirit” of Xi’s thinking was now the Chinese capital’s “top priority”. 
In an interview on the eve of Xi’s ideological elevation, Susan Shirk, a noted China expert who was US deputy assistant secretary of state under Bill Clinton, said she currently saw no sign of “popular concern” about his rule. “He appears to be very popular with the public … people in China like a strong leader - just like people in America like a strong leader.”
“I’m waiting to see, for example: Is there more political study in secondary schools? Are these middle class parents going to have their kids wasting their time studying the latest version of Chinese Marxism, which they think is somehow going to hold them back in their educational and career ambitions? I’m waiting to see the ways - if he pursues this kind of more totalitarian vision over society - that society may push back.”
Shirk, the head of the 21st Century China Centre at the University of California, San Diego, said she suspected a “dictatorial” and highly ideological model would not easily mesh with the realities of 21st century China.
