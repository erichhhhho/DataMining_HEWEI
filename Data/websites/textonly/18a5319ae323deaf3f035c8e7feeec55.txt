Just tried it and it takes a while to beffer and then it is great. Any idea the fastest way to use it? w/ vpn? Which server?
I tried last year, even with a VPN it's bad. What I did is turning to KODI and never looked back since.
Which addons do you use? I stopped with Kodi becasue it seemeded like 90% didn't work and whenever I found one that did it would stop after a few weeks.
Covenant, actually all developers that used to work on Exodus moved to do Covenant, for now the most active addon for movies and tv series. Also, for this you need VPN connection too ( Japan, Taiwan servers are excellent ).
