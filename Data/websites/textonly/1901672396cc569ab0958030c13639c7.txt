The Communist party prepares to hail mid-point of Xi Jinpingâs 10-year term. But what do people make of their leader? 
âHe was just over there,â reminisced Huang, the 45-year-old owner of a harbour-side equipment shop, motioning excitedly into the street to where Xiâs motorcade passed by. âThe window was half open and he looked out at us and smiled. When he waved, it was as if it was in slow motion â he didnât say a single word, but I felt so excited.â

But as Xi completes his first term, experts say that many of Chinaâs 1.4 billion citizens see him in a far more favourable light.
Outside his shop, a portrait of Xi â his hands clasped together â captured the image spin doctors have tried to curate of their commander-in-chief: a sagacious and omnipotent father figure leading his subjects towards âThe China Dreamâ. An accompanying slogan stated: âThe Dream of a Powerful Country. The Rejuvenation of China. The Happiness of the People. The Wealth of the Nation.â
Orville Schell, a veteran China expert from New Yorkâs Asia Society, said he sensed âa cauldron of disaffectionâ bubbling beneath the surface towards Chinaâs political leaders. But many citizens applauded how Xi was strutting Chinaâs stuff on the world stage. âI suspect that on a surface level â but an important level â many Chinese feel a certain amount of pride that their country is now able to speak, even throw its weight around a little, and be heeded in the world,â he said.
Xi had ceded almost no ground to Trump on any of these issues, Tsang said. âAnd what have the Americans done? Nothing! So you can see why the average Chinese citizen might think Xi Jinping was doing really well.â
At Tanmenâs docks, Qin Huaishu, another of the presidentâs fans, was giving a new lick of paint to Qionghai 09045, a weathered fishing vessel that was turned into a permanent floating monument to Xi after he clambered on board during his 2013 visit.
âXi chatted with the fishermen about their daily lives and went downstairs to check the engine,â recalled Qin, a 55-year-old workman. âXi told the fishermen: âGo out and be bold. We support you allâ.â
The âchairman of everythingâ looked down from the wall behind him in an immaculately ironed blue shirt.
