A New Zealand MP embroiled in a controversy over his past links to Chinese military intelligence worked as an intern with the Australian Senate's committee on foreign affairs, defence and trade in the 1990s.
In his application for New Zealand residency in 1998, Mr Yang did not detail the sensitive nature of the institution he worked at, disclosing only employment with "Luoyang University".
"During September and November 1994, I worked as an intern in Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the Australian Parliament," he wrote in his residency application.
"I was asked to write a report on the extension of social and cultural ties between Australia and [the People's Republic of] China."
Mr Yang was a lecturer in political science at Auckland University before becoming a National Party MP in 2014.
Canberra's top intelligence agency ASIO warned of the "unprecedented" level of "harmful espionage and foreign interference" operations being carried out in Australia
Mr Yang acknowledged he had been involved in teaching English to Chinese spies, but has defended the level of detail he disclosed to the New Zealand government, saying the National Party was "fully aware" of his background before his nomination.
Releasing the information, Immigration New Zealand said: "We note that Mr Yang met all the requirements under the relevant legislation at the time of his residence application and no character concerns were identified at the time."
