The fungi, some of which are 83.5cm high, were found by a farmer foraging for mushrooms near a village in Tengchong in Yunnan province, Yn.yunnan.cn reported.
“I’m 81 years old and have never seen such a big mushroom in my life,” the farmer was quoted as saying.
Yang Zhuliang, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Botany in Kunming, told the website the giant mushrooms were edible.
The farmer has put a fence around the mushrooms to protect them from visitors taking selfies and to stop them from eating them.
