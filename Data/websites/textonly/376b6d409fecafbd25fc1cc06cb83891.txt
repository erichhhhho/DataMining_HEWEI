The terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir are using Chinese grenades in terror attacks, but these grenades aren't exploding, after all, they are Chinese. An unidentified group of terrorists on Friday evening threw a Chinese grenade at Barari Pora Chowk in Srinagar, reported ANI. However, the grenades didn't explode.
This is not the first incident where grenades have been used by terrorists.  Earlier in September, one person was killed along with 14 others injured after terrorists threw a grenade at Jehangir Chowk in Srinagar. Even a day before this incident, the suspected terrorists had lobbed a grenade on a police station in Shopian which didn't explode.  A FIR was lodged in this regard.
