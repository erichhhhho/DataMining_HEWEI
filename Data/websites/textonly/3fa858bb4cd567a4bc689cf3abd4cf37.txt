As per title, I could stream for a little bit from Australia on the inke app. Just walking through the city showing off tourist spots, today I get a message that says I am unable to stream from my area.. not sure if this a recent Australian thing or if they came up with a bull shit excuse to stop a white guy streaming or if there is an important political event happening soon? 
Only verified Chinese (because you need a Chinese ID) users can stream from Chinese streaming apps. That you were able to stream for so long is strange indeed. 
It was my wife's account with her Id linked, we would appear together on the same stream so I don't think it would be that
Maybe it's because of the Congress and they are stopping any sort of streams from outside. No idea. Everyone is panicking here because vpns are stopping working. 
Ah I didn't realise Congress was on, could be that as Livestreaming in Xinjiang looks recently blocked aswell. I will have to wait and see.
