The tensions ran high first in late August 1945, when groups of Soviet soldiers repeatedly raided Tonghua Girl`s High School, raping, abducting and killing both students and teachers. At least one shootout with teacher possessing a concealed pistol was also reported, leading to additional raids. Participation of the male teachers in the rapes was also reported.
The gang rapes, even in broad daylight on the streets, has happened, and at least one Soviet officer was shot dead while trying to stop his fellow soldiers. Japanese refugees responded mainly by shaving the women`s head bald, applying dirt and grease to the skin, and wearing a storage bags instead of normal clothes.
In the early November 1945, all property of people of Japanese ancestry was confiscated, and all Japanese males aged between 15 and 60 were forced to labour teams. From the 17 November 1945, Chinese Communist forces were raiding arbitrarily Japanese homes in search of weapons, and drafting everybody to labour teams, regardless of gender or age. Forced eviction of Japanese people from their dwelling has also started.
21 January 1946, further arrests and detentions of Japanese in the aftermath of the murders of high-ranking Japanese civilian leader.
At the morning 3 February 1946, all Japanese males 16-years old or older, and suspected females, frequently wearing only pajamas, were forced out of refugee camp, chained and forced to march 15Â km at the minus 20 degrees weather. Anybody falling from exhaustion or wounds was shot dead.
About 3,000 Japanese men and women were packed in the old warehouses, packing 5 persons per square meter. A lot of them went berserk because of the lack of oxygen, but anybody climbing a window was shot. Soon the flooring has turned into the pool of blood, and people continue to die still standing. Even corpses would not fall because of extreme crowding. About 2,000 civilians who did not fit into warehouses were plainly shot nearby.
