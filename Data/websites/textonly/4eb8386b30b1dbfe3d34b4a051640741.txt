A top Chinese official has claimed several high-ranking members of the Communist Party had plotted to seize power from President Xi Jinping.
These party members have since been arrested or jailed in a wide-reaching corruption crackdown launched by Mr Xi.
On Thursday, the chief of China's securities commissions, Liu Shiyu, listed names of six "high-ranking and powerful officials, who were hugely greedy and hugely corrupt, and who plotted to usurp the party's leadership and seize state power".

                    Mr Zhou was the chief of security in China until his arrest in 2014
                
"These cases were definitely shocking," said Mr Liu, who was speaking at a panel for the ongoing Communist Party congress in Beijing.
Mr Liu said that Mr Xi had "addressed these problems, and eliminated a huge and hidden danger to the party and the country".
More than one million officials have been jailed or arrested in the corruption crackdown which began shortly after Mr Xi took power in 2012.
The depth of the crackdown has led many to speculate that some arrests were politically motivated and that part of Mr Xi's overall strategy was to consolidate power.
But the comments appear to corroborate what has long been suspected - that there are intense power struggles going on behind the party's image of unity, says the BBC's Michael Bristow.
The claim comes as Mr Xi created his own political ideology, in the latest move to entrench his position in the Communist Party.
The party is widely expected to rewrite its constitution to enshrine this theory before congress ends next week.
