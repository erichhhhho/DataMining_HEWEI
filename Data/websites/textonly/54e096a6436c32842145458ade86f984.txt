Did I miss any blogs about Chongqing? Have you written about your time in this Chinese megacity? Let me know and I‚Äôll add it to the list!
Nothing that notable to say yet.  I‚Äôm a native Michigander with a passion for human culture and new places, and more than that, new experiences.  I have degrees in writing and anthropology and have no idea what I want to do with them.  For now, I‚Äôm content with an unbound lifestyle; going where I want and doing what I can, and hopefully gaining some interesting stories along the way.
Wow thanks for all this work! I was in Chongqing last February, really fascinating city, your article is making me want to go back üôÇ
Just visiting, I went to visit a language exchange friend. I loved the hilly aspect to Chongqing, a big contrast to Foshan where I‚Äôd just come from. And the smell of chilli peppers in the air‚Ä¶.ahhh üôÇ What a great city!
This is awesome! How did I not find your site before moving to Chongqing? I had no idea that there were many people blogging about this wonderful city Chongqing. I would be honered if you would add mine (even though I just started this week). Glad to see more people who love it here!
Thanks for writing. I‚Äôll gladly add you to the list. I‚Äôm travelling the moment but will be updating a lot of things when I return to chongqing in a couple weeks. I hope you‚Äôre enjoying the city so far!
Hey Ben ‚Äì Zach of Square Inch Anthropology here. I really appreciate the kind mention in this post, and thanks for sharing the love!
