Next semester (starting February 2018), I will be studying at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University for 5 months. Do you perhaps have advice for me? What to do? What not to do? 
One of friend's is doing a PH.D. there. The area directly around the campus is actually pretty nice with a good amount of open land. Mostly students and a couple good bars. 
Lots of foreigners around that area too. Drinking seemed similar to the UK, without as many options for bars/clubs. 
February is still winter and maybe surprisingly cold in Suzhou (can stay quite cold till late March sometimes even) so bear that in mind.
Also, things might just be getting back into gear from Chinese new year (SIP is almost empty over CNY) so it might seem a bit dead at first.
