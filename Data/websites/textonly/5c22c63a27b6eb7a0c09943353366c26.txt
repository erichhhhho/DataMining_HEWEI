BBC, the Financial Times, the New York Times and the Guardian all refused access to unveiling of new politburo
In a statement, the Foreign Correspondents Club of China (FCCC) said it was concerned about the exclusions.
“The press conference is a high profile news event involving China’s top leadership and it is hard to avoid the conclusion that these media organisations have been singled out to send a message,” it said. 
“Using media access as a tool to punish journalists whose coverage the Chinese authorities disapprove of is a gross violation of the principles of press freedom,” the group added.
In his address to handpicked journalists on Wednesday, Xi said: “The party congress has received extensive and detailed reporting from our friends in the press, with many of you coming from afar. You have worked very hard and your media coverage has captured the attention of the world. I want to say a big thank you to you all.”
However, he also issued a thinly-veiled rebuke to foreign journalists who publish reports that question the party line. 
“We do not need lavish praise from others. However, we do welcome objective reporting and constructive suggestions.”
Beijing has attempted to contrast its supposedly open congress with Donald Trump’s hostility towards the media.
“The Party congress has become more open and transparent, which reflects the growing confidence of the ruling party of a large country like China,” Dong Guanpeng, the head of the media and public relations institute at the Communication University of China told Xinhua, China’s official news agency.
Asked about the exclusions, China’s foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said: “What I can tell you is that we welcome foreign journalists to interview and report on the 19th party congress and handle foreign journalists’ applications according to laws and regulations.”
In a statement to AFP the congress’ media centre said it had “tried [its] best to allow more foreign journalists to attend this event”.
