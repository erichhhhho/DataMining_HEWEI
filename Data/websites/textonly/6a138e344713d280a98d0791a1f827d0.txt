But that will be difficult to do now. In a Weibo post that has since been deleted, user @åå°ç· claimed that Peng was straight, but, in order to climb up the entertainment industry ladder, he had offered himself up to Zhang.
As evidence, the Weibo user posted a screencap of a WeChat group chat conversation in which anonymous sources were discussing the pair's alleged relationship, claiming that Peng had slept with Zhang and that Peng was actually versatile (both a top or bottom).
A famous social media celebrity with more than 900,000 followers also posted a vague Weibo post about Peng and Zhang, which was retweeted by Liu Chun, CEO of Zhongnan Film and former vice-president of Sohu.com. That post has also since been deleted.
