EIA uncovered Shuidong’s critical role in the ivory trade gradually. In 2014, EIA investigators met Wei Ronglu, a Shuidong native living in Zanzibar. He explained how people from his hometown smuggled ivory. Acting on rumors that ivory-smuggling syndicates were shifting their activity from Tanzania to Mozambique, EIA investigators traveled to Pemba in 2016 and approached a Shuidong trafficking group, masquerading as potential buyers. After winning the smugglers’ trust, investigators started to gather evidence, some of which is shown in this video as undercover footage.
EIA also discloses a key smuggling route that runs from Pemba, Mozambique, to Busan, South Korea, then Hong Kong, Shanghai, and finally Shuidong. This intentionally circuitous route, paired with the underground business’ inherent secrecy, will require a multi-national and multi-institutional effort to shut down. Now, the question is whether China will participate in those efforts in a way that will give its ban real teeth.
