Wall Street Journal says the US president called for Guo Wenguiâs deportation after casino owner Steve Wynn brought letter from Beijing government
 However, two days later, just before leaving the country, the Chinese officials paid a second visit to Guo, triggering a debate within the administration over whether they should be arrested. FBI agents were posted at John F Kennedy airport ready to carry out the arrests before the officials boarded their flight, but they were not made, after the state department argued it could trigger a diplomatic crisis.
The report said the letter had been hand-delivered to him at a private dinner by Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas casino magnate and Republican National Committee finance chairman with interests in the Chinese gambling enclave of Macau, for which Wynn relies on Beijing for licensing.
 The marketing director for Wynn Resorts Ltd, Michael Weaver, told the Journal in a written statement: â[T]hat report regarding Mr Wynn is false. Beyond that, he doesnât have any comment.â
 Weaver did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian on what part of the story was false and whether Wynn had ever delivered a letter from the Chinese government to Trump.
 The Journal report said that aides tried to persuade Trump out of going ahead with Guoâs deportation, noting he was a member of the presidentâs Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. The aides later ensured that the deportation would not go ahead. 
 There was no immediate response from the White House or the state department to a request to comment on the report. A state department representative told the Journal: âDecisions on these kinds of matters are based on interagency consensus.â
A justice department representative said: âIt is a criminal offense for an individual, other than a diplomatic or consular officer or attache, to act in the United States as an agent of a foreign power without prior notification to the attorney general.â
