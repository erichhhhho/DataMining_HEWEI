On a tropical island that marks the southern tip of China, a computer program called Lengpudashi is playing one-on-one poker against a dozen people at once, and itâs absolutely crushing them. Lengpudashi, which means âcold poker masterâ in Mandarin, is using a new artificial-intelligence technique to outbet and outbluff its opponents in a two-player version of Texas hold âem.
The venue for the tournament is a modern-looking technology park in Haikou, capital of the island of Hainan. Outside, modern high-rises loom over aging neighborhoods. Those gathered to play the machine include several poker champs, some well-known Chinese investors, entrepreneurs, and CEOs, and even the odd television celebrity. The games are being broadcast online, and millions are watching. The event symbolizes a growing sense of excitement and enthusiasm for artificial intelligence in China, but thereâs also a problem. Lengpudashi wasnât made in Hainan, Beijing, or Shanghai; it was built in Pittsburgh, U.S.A.
For many in China, this simply wonât do. The country is now embarking on an unprecedented effort to master artificial intelligence. Its government is planning to pour hundreds of billions of yuan (tens of billions of dollars) into the technology in coming years, and companies are investing heavily in nurturing and developing AI talent. If this country-Â­wide effort succeedsâand there are many signs it willâChina could emerge as a leading force in AI, improving the productivity of its industries and helping it become leader in creating new businesses that leverage the technology. And if, as many believe, AI is the key to future growth, Chinaâs prowess in the field will help fortify its position as the dominant economic power in the world.
Artificial intelligence may have been invented in the West, but you can see its future taking shape on the other side of the world.
Our editors pick the 50 companies that best combine innovative technology with an effective business model.
The governmentâs call to action will accelerate what has already begun to happen. The countryâs tech companies, led by the Internet giants Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent, are hiring scores of AI experts, building new research centers, and investing in data centers that rival anything operated by Amazon, Google, or Microsoft. Money is also pouring into countless startups as Chinese entrepreneurs and investors spy a huge opportunity to harness AI in different industries.
China has some big advantages in AI. It has a wealth of talented engineers and scientists, for one. It also is rich in the data necessary to train AI systems. With fewer obstacles to data collection and use, China is amassing huge databases that donât exist in other countries. The results can be seen in the growth of facial-recognition systems based on machine learning: they now identify workers at offices and customers in stores, and they authenticate users of mobile apps.
To explore Chinaâs AI revolution and its implications, Iâve traveled to the heart of this boom and met with many of the key researchers, entrepreneurs, and executives. From Chinaâs bustling capital to its factory-filled south, and from an ambitious new research center to a billion-dollar startup, one thing is clear: artificial intelligence may have been invented in the West, but you can see its future taking shape on the other side of the world.
Lee gives a talk entirely in Mandarin to an auditorium packed with about 300 Chinese students. He is dressed impeccably, in an expensive-looking suit and dress shirt, and he speaks in a confident, soothing tone. The talk touches on the interwoven trends that have driven the recent rise in machine intelligence: more powerful computers, ingenious new algorithms, and huge quantities of data. He argues that China is perfectly poised to take advantage of these advances.
âThe U.S. and Canada have the best AI researchers in the world, but China has hundreds of people who are good, and way more data,â he tells the audience. âAI is an area where you need to evolve the algorithm and the data together; a large amount of data makes a large amount of difference.â
In the audience are exactly the type of prized students who would normally flock to Silicon Valley. But many are clearly taken by Leeâs message of opportunities in China. The crowd hangs on his every word, and some people clamor for autographs afterward. âToday the U.S. has a technology leadership,â Lee tells me later. âBut China has a tremendous amount of potential.â
âThe titans of industry [in China] have seen fortunes made and fortunes lost all within their lifetime.â
AlphaGoâs victories in Wuzhen are followed closely in the Chinese capital. As I enter Sinovationâs institute, in fact, I notice a Go board on which engineers are testing out the moves made during some of the matches.
The location of the institute is well chosen. From the office windows, you can see the campuses of both Peking University and Tsinghua University, two of Chinaâs top academic institutions. Sinovation provides machine-learning tools and data sets to train Chinese engineers, and it offers expertise for companies hoping to make use of AI. The institute has about 30 full-time employees so far, but the plan is to employ more than 100 by next year, and to train hundreds of AI experts each year through internships and boot camps. Right now, roughly 80 percent of the instituteâs funding and projects are aimed at commercializing AI, while the rest is focused on more far-out technology research and startup incubation.
The goal isnât to invent the next AlphaGo, though; itâs to upgrade thousands of companies across China using AI. Lee says many Chinese businesses, including the big state-owned enterprises, are technologically backward and ripe for overhaul, but they lack any AI expertise themselves. Needless to say, this presents an enormous opportunity.
Across the capital, in fact, I notice a remarkable amount of interest in artificial intelligence. In one restaurant, for instance, I find a machine that takes my picture and then supposedly uses AI to determine how healthy I am. This seems completely impossible, but the machine says Iâm in great shape before suggesting that I have plenty to eat.
Earlier this year SenseTimeâs engineers developed a novel image-processing technique for automatically removing smog and rain from photographs, and another for tracking full-body motion using a single camera. Last year they were part of a team that won a prestigious international computer-vision award.
In the United States and other Western nations, many large sectors, such as manufacturing and services, have been slow to invest in AI and change their business practices. In China, there appears to be a greater sense of urgency about adapting to the changing technology. Across just about every industry, Chinese companies are shrugging off their reputation for following Western businesses, and investing heavily in research and development. Ng, who previously led Baiduâs AI effort, says Chinaâs business leaders understand better than most the need to embrace new trends. âThe titans of industry [in China] have seen fortunes made and fortunes lost all within their lifetime,â he says. âWhen you see the tech trends shift, you had better move quickly, or someone else will beat you.â
Baidu anticipated the potential of artificial intelligence and sought to leverage it to reinvent its whole business. In 2014, the company created a lab dedicated to applying deep learning across its business, and in recent years, its researchers have made some significant advances. When Microsoft developed a system capable of better-than-human performance in speech recognition last year, for instance, few Western reporters realized that Baidu had done that a year earlier.
Shenzhen is nestled next to Hong Kong in southern China. Approaching by air, I see an armada of cargo ships moored in the South China Sea. In 1980, when Shenzhen was a small market town, it was designated Chinaâs first Special Economic Zone, granting it unprecedented economic and regulatory freedoms. Manufacturing empires were built on the backs of migrant workers producing every imaginable product, and the population rose from 30,000 to more than 11 million. In recent years, the city has reflected Chinaâs technological progress, and it is now home to global technology companies including the networking giant Huawei, the smartphone maker ZTE, and the electric-car company BYD.
Thereâs no reason why Chinaâs AI-fueled economic progress should come at the expense of other countries, if those countries embrace the same technology just as keenly.
Face-detecting systems in China now authorize payments, provide access to facilities, and track down criminals. Will other countries follow?
I ask him if Tencent might be planning some spectacular demonstrations of AI, something like AlphaGo or Lengpudashi. Tencent owns several very popular games, including the strategy title League of Legends, which is played by more than 100 million people every month. Like Go, it requires instinctive actions, and like poker, it involves playing without a clear picture of your opponentsâ standing. But it also requires planning far ahead, so it would be a worthy game for AI researchers to tackle next. âRight now, we have a bunch of small projectsâsome are more adventurous,â is all Zhang will say.
Tencentâs AI goals may in fact be more practical. The company has an amazing amount of conversation data thanks to WeChat and another messaging platform, called QQ. This data might be used to train machine-learning systems to hold more meaningful conversations. Making advances in language could have countless practical applications, from better document analysis and search to much smarter personal assistants. âThe challenge, and also the opportunity, will be in natural language,â Zhang says.
It might be unnerving for Western nations to see a newcomer mastering an important technology, especially when the full potential of that technology remains uncertain. But it is wrong to view this story simply in terms of competition with the West.
A big problem facing both the U.S. and China is slowing economic growth. While AI may eliminate certain jobs, it also has the potential to greatly expand the economy and create wealth by making many industries far more efficient and productive. China has embraced that simple fact more eagerly and more completely than many Western nations. But thereâs no reason why Chinaâs AI-fueled economic progress should come at the expense of other countries, if those countries embrace the same technology just as keenly.
China might have unparalleled resources and enormous untapped potential, but the West has world-Â­leading expertise and a strong research culture. Rather than worry about Chinaâs progress, it would be wise for Western nations to focus on their existing strengths, investing heavily in research and education. The risk is missing out on an incredibly important technological shift. Yes, companies like Google and Facebook are making important strides in AI today, but this isnât enough to reboot a whole economy. Despite the fanfare around AI, there are few economic signsâsuch as increased productivityâthat most of the economy is taking advantage of the technology yet. Large segments of the economy beyond Silicon Valley, like medicine, service industries, and manufacturing, also need to sign on.
I canât help thinking of the poker tournament in Hainan and reflecting that the rest of the world should take inspiration from Lengpudashi, the poker-playing AI. Itâs time to follow Chinaâs lead and go all in on artificial intelligence.
Quantum computers will soon surpass conventional ones, but it will take time to make the machines useful.
