  China will be a leading nation in terms of national power and
  global impact by 2050, Chinese President Xi Jinping told
  Communist Party officials in a major address in Beijing on
  Wednesday. Xi announced a two-stage plan to become a âgreat
  modern socialist countryâ, split between 2020 to 2035 and 2035 to
  2050.


  The five-yearly meeting sets out the vision and policies and
  establishes the partyâs top leadership for the next term. More
  than 2,200 delegates have gathered in Beijing for the congress
  while the Communist Partyâs economic and political announcements
  are being watched very closely.


  China, which Xi said is the worldâs âlargest developing countryâ,
  is currently the worldâs second largest economy and has the
  second largest stock market. Over decades of providing foreign
  aid, China has also recently emerged as the worldâs largest
  foreign aid donor.
