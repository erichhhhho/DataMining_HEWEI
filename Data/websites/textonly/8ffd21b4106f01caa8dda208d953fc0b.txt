WeChat Profile Changes Banned, Delivery and Hospitality Services Disrupted Ahead of 19th National Congress
Beijing residents are reporting widespread interruptions in courier express services via China’s Twitter-like Weibo. Some packages are delayed, others completely suspended. A staff from SF Express, one of the country’s biggest express services, told TechNode that packages going to the capital from Henan and Hainan Provinces have already been suspended, and vice versa.
“Express services in Beijing are still operating, but it’s hard to say when your package will arrive because security check has tightened up. I suggest that you wait till the Congress ends to ship your parcel,” SF Express staff told us.
For security reasons, Beijing is banning the use of small aircraft including drones and fire balloons during the Congress, says a notice released by the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau. Parts and components of small aircrafts are restricted items for delivery to Beijing this week, according to SF Express.
