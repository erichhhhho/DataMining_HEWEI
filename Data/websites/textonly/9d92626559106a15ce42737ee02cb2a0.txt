Tiangong-1,
which means “The Heavenly Palace," was launched into orbit back in 2011.
This relatively small 10.3-meter-long (34-foot) space station was China’s first
space-laboratory module, making it a major milestone in their drive to become a
science superpower. 
However, after fulfilling its historic mission, its
communication links fell silent in March 2016 and its mission was
terminated. Now, the space station is returning from the heavens
after idly orbiting Earth for the past few months.  
Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics, told The Guardian on Friday: “Now that [its] perigee
is below 300 kilometers [186 miles] and it is in denser atmosphere, the rate of
decay is getting higher.”
“Most
of the structural components of Tiangong-1 will be destroyed through burning
during the course of its re-entry,” added UNOOSA. “The probability of
endangering and causing damage to aviation and ground activities is very low.”
Wu
Ping, deputy director of China's manned space engineering office, also told a
press conference last year: "Based on our calculation and
analysis, most parts of the space lab will burn up during falling."
However,
it is possible that small pieces of debris no larger than 100 kilograms
(220 pounds) will reach Earth’s surface, according to McDowell. Far bigger
man-made objects have previously made uncontrolled re-entry into Earth's
atmosphere without too much drama. Most notably, Russia's space station Mir
– weighing a hefty 120,000 kilograms (265,000 pounds) –
plummeted to Earth in 2001.
While
you should not expect a spectacular crash, it does mean you might be able to
see streaks of debris from Tiangong-1 burn up in Earth’s atmosphere. You can
track the location and progress of Tiangong-1 through the website
Heavens-Above, although the exact date of its return to Earth remains
unknown for now.

JIUQUAN, CHINA — China says its first space lab Tiangong-1 will likely fall back to Earth in the second half of 2017, which seems to confirm speculation that it has already lost control of the spacecraft.

Tiangong-1 spacecraft is currently orbiting Earth at an altitude of 370 km, which is about 30 km lower than the orbit of the International Space Station. It was launched in September 2011 and has stopped sending data back to Earth since March this year.

“Based on our calculation and analysis, most parts of the space lab will burn up during falling,” Wu Ping, deputy director of the manned space engineering office said in a press conference.

However, satellite tracker Thomas Dorman thinks such statement has confirmed his view that China has lost control of Tiangong-1 and the country will only inform the world at the very last minute, Space.com reported.

According to Xinhua News, China will continue to monitor Tiangong-1 and send out warnings for possible collisions with objects and report internationally if necessary.

Chinese authorities confirm the eight-tonne ‘Heavenly Palace’ lab will re-enter the atmosphere sometime in 2017 with some parts likely to hit Earth.
https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/21/chinas-tiangong-1-space-station-out-of-control-crash-to-earth

China\'s first space station, Tiangong-1, is expected to fall to Earth sometime in late 2017. 
https://phys.org/news/2016-09-doomed-tiangong-chinese-space-station.html

It is predicted that debris will land anywhere between 43° north and 43° north south of the equator, a large swathe of the globe in which almost 90% of human population resides. 

The odds of a specific person being hit are very low, but the chance of someone being hit are relatively high, about 1 in 3,200. 
Eight tonnes of burning metal will certainly also be observable in the sky – and plenty of observers will track the spacecraft, even if its final entry point will not be known until entry occurs.

China\'s Tiangong-1 Space Lab to Fall to Earth by April 2018

The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) has reissued a notification by China on the future uncontrolled re-entry of the country\'s robotic Tiangong-1 space lab, which is expected to take place in the next eight months.

Tiangong-1, which has been orbiting Earth since September 2011, ceased functioning on March 16, 2016. To date, the spacecraft has maintained its structural integrity.

CHINA — China\'s Tiangong-1 space station will crash into Earth within the next few months, according to experts. 

The Tiangong-1 was launched in 2011 as part of China\'s push to become a space superpower and has been used for manned and unmanned missions, the Guardian reported. 

In 2016, Chinese officials confirmed that they lost control of the space station and that it would crash to Earth in 2017 or 2018. 

The station\'s orbit has been steadily decaying ever since then. Over the past few weeks, the 8.5-tonne station has dipped below 300 km in altitude. When the Tiangong-1 was operational, the lab orbited at an altitude of 370 km. 
 
The lower the altitude, the denser the atmosphere and the faster the Tiangong-1 will burn up. 

Most of the space station is expected to disintegrate in the atmosphere, but experts say some parts weighing up to 100 kg could reach the Earth\'s surface, the Guardian reported. 

China\'s space agency has told the UN it expects the Tiangong-1 to come down between October 2017 and April 2018.

The Chinese space station Tiangong-1 is falling towards Earth in an uncontrolled descent and will hit the planet sometime within the next few months or even days.

Chinese officials confirmed last year that they lost control of the country’s first orbiting space station when they failed to correct its altitude. 

According to the Guardian, officials initially predicted the space station would crash between October 2017 and April 2018, but Harvard University astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell said the crash could actually occur earlier in that time frame. 

“Now that [its] perigee is below 300km [186 miles] and it is in denser atmosphere, the rate of decay is getting higher,” McDowell told the Guardian. “I expect it will come down a few months from now – late 2017 or early 2018.”

Unfortunately, it’s nearly impossible to predict exactly when and where the crash will occur, McDowell said. In fact, a minor change in atmospheric conditions could move the landing site “from one continent to the next,” he said.

The Chinese space station Tiangong-1 is falling towards Earth in an uncontrolled descent and will hit the planet sometime within the next few months or even days.

Chinese officials confirmed last year that they lost control of the country’s first orbiting space station when they failed to correct its altitude. 

According to the Guardian, officials initially predicted the space station would crash between October 2017 and April 2018, but Harvard University astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell said the crash could actually occur earlier in that time frame. 

“Now that [its] perigee is below 300km [186 miles] and it is in denser atmosphere, the rate of decay is getting higher,” McDowell told the Guardian. “I expect it will come down a few months from now – late 2017 or early 2018.”
