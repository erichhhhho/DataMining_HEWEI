Under Xi Jinping, China has become more powerful and confident than it perhaps has been for two centuries
These statements are remarkable from a party which has long tried to keep a low profile. It has always extolled the value of its system, but has never explicitly suggested it was something that could be exported around the world.
Such confidence could easily be interpreted as hubris and it may well prove to be so, but there are a number of reasons why China is more powerful and more confident than it perhaps has been for two centuries.
The first is that the leadership, at least in public, believes it has stabilised the economy after a brief crisis two years ago, and returned the country to healthy growth. After also getting through the global financial crisis intact 10 years ago, the self-belief is enormous.
In Xi, the country has the most disciplined and most powerful leader in a generation. Trump, by contrast, is the most undisciplined and, judging by his record in Congress, ineffective president for generations. It is a stark and, for those who believe in democracyâs efficacies, depressing contrast.
For the moment, China, like many other countries, has some breathing room on pressure for change because of the general buoyancy of the global economy. Given Chinaâs debt, however, that could change quickly. The path of strong growth built on rising debt means a financial crisis of some kind will inevitably follow.
For all those qualifications, the sheer, overwhelming triumphalism in Beijing this week should finally provide a wakeup call to those in the west who have long believed not just that China would fail. Many were convinced that, as an authoritarian state, that it must fail.
For the moment, however, China is succeeding. If it continues on its current path, the world as we have known it will never be the same again.
