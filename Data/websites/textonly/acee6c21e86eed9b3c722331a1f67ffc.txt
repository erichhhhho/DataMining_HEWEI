Well, October 18th seems to have come and gone in China without the missile hoopla from North Korea many were predicting to have occurred by now. There’s been plenty of solid reporting on the North Korean Nuclear issue over the past several months. Most articles provide good analysis about what’s happening. Of course, there’s also a lot of editorialized or sensationalized news out there as well. For the reader who hasn’t kept up, here’s a brief primer about where we sit today given the past couple of months’ activity.
“They are preparing for new tests of a long-range missile. They even gave us mathematical calculations that they believe prove that their missile can hit the west coast of the United States”.
So far, this missile that has purportedly been moved to the coast to prepare for launch has not been fired.
As this situation continues to escalate over time, the ramifications of a misguided stray test-missile landing on a foreign territory increase.
