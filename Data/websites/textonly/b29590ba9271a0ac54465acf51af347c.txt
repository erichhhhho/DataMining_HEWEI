Banks often serve large companies; they don’t have the ability to serve small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) well
What Manchu resources. Books, audiovisual foremost, but also curious about presential classes or tutors, if only for reference
When I input my card information I keep getting the message that the card number is wrong. I know that I'm not messing this up so how do I properly put in the info? This is for the American Amazon website if that makes a difference. 
Hmm...at a guess it sounds like Alipay. I can use it in China but get “error” messages saying it can only be used outside China by Chinese ID card holders. 
is it a double currency card? my card supports both yuan and dollar so it works on Amazon.cn's 海外购, never tried on Amazon.com though
As far as I understand, foreigners are locked from any sort of foreign currency transactions online in China.
When using a Unionpay card, Alipay or Wechat Pay, you'll be prompted to enter a Chinese name and ID number in order to complete the transaction. No passport numbers unfortunately.
Just so u know.. there is no protection with unionpay or Chinese credit cards. If someone gets hold of your pass and use your card. You are on your own.
