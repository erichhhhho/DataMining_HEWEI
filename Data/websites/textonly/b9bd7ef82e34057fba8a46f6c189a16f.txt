China has a ton of regional variation when it comes to food. Some of the tastiest and most popular regional cuisines come from 8 provinces: Anhui, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Sichuan, and Zhejiang.

One of Hangzhou's most famous dish is "Beggar's Chicken". It's not the most appetizing name, but the dish is famous for a good reason (hint: it's delicious). The story goes that a Hangzhou beggar had stolen a chicken from a farm. But the beggar didn't have any pots or utensils to prepare the chicken. So he came up with an idea. He wrapped the chicken in lotus leaves and packed it with clay to form a makeshift pot. Then he dug a hole in the ground, lit it with fire, and buried the chicken to cook. When he dug up and unwrapped the chicken, he discovered that baking the chicken in lotus leaves and clay had made the chicken unbelievably tender and aromatic.
After eating his fill, he realized he had an incredibly delicious discovery on him. So he stole some more chickens, cooked them using his patented process, and sold them on the streets of Hangzhou. Beggar's Chickenâ¢ caught on with the locals and the former beggar and thief became a successful food vendor and lived happily ever after.
