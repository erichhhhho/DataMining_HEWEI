On the morning of October 10, the Guangzhou City Public Security Fire Brigade’s Asian Games Squadron received a call from a local hospital saying that they needed help removing a metal wrench from around a patient’s penis. 
According to firefighters involved in the genital rescue, when they arrived at the hospital they found the man’s seriously swollen penis firmly set in the wrench.  
Over the next two hours, the first responders were able to free the man’s ‘100 percent all-meat thermometer’ using an angle grinder in what we surmise was an exceptionally delicate operation.
In Guangzhou, we are all too familiar with reporting on foreign objects (cups, bottles and an eel, to name a few) getting unceremoniously stuck in people's asses, but a penis stuck in a metal wrench? This is a new one for us down south. (Although, it’s worth noting, another man did get his junk stuck in a wrench up in Zhejiang this past June).
