Chinese president channelled Hugo ChÃ¡vez with marathon 65-page sermon setting out vision for Communist party
China's president, Xi Jinping, called corruption the greatest threat to the Communist partyâs survival in his opening speech to the week-long congress meeting on Wednesday. However, the problem is largely a product of the one-party political system he leads.
Xiâs soliloquy began shortly after 9am in the Great Hall of the People, a vast scarlet-carpeted theatre in Tiananmen Square that is the ceremonial heart of Communist party rule.
âComrades,â Xi began. âOn behalf of the 18th central committee of the Communist party of China, I will now deliver a report to the 19th national congress.â
Over the next 203 minutes Xi waxed lyrical on a miscellany of themes, from housing to Hong Kong independence; soil erosion to the South China Sea; rural poverty to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation; cyber-security to corruption; Marxism to military modernisation; global governance to global warming.
One moment Xi was an environmental evangelist. âLucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets,â he said. âWe should be good friends to the environment â¦ for the sake of human survival.â
The next he was a theoretician: âEveryone in the party should develop a good grasp of the essence and rich implications of the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and fully and faithfully apply it in our our work,â Xi said. âOur revolutionary ideals soar beyond the skies.â
But after 90 minutes of Xiâs talkathon, the end was nowhere in sight and through binoculars it was possible to see party officials beginning to flag. 
yawned, dozed and occasionally grappled with a large white magnifying glass in an apparent effort to stay awake
As the minutes, and then hours went by, a succession of senior leaders wandered off stage through a golden curtain, as biological necessities began to speak louder than political loyalty.
Up in the press gallery there was fidgeting too. Black-clad security guards amused themselves by posing for photographs. At the two-hour 15 mark, a text message flashed up on the Guardianâs mobile phone from another spectator: âJinping Castro,â it said.
However, as delegates streamed out of Xiâs far-reaching declamation there was nothing but admiration for the thoughts of a man increasingly seen as Chinaâs most powerful â and feared â leader since Mao. 
âWhat an exciting speech!â gushed Fu Chunli, a delegate from the far western region of Xinjiang. âSuch a good report, written into the hearts of 1.3 billion people!â
âYes [long] â but exciting,â agreed Tang Jialing, a third emissary. âI hope all party members â like me â can turn this blueprint into reality as soon as possible.â
Might Xiâs address have been too long? âI think he just read it a little bit slower,â Kuhn replied, diplomatically. âAnd in a very confident way.â
âI canât hold it any more,â one female delegate confessed, declining an interview request as she made a dash for the toilets outside the hallâs main auditorium. âI really need to go to the loo!â
His suffering as a teenager under the excesses of Maoism has not stopped the president pursuing unassailable authority
While the explosion of sycophancy over Chinaâs president may seem almost comical, his reign will have ramifications far beyond the countryâs borders
In his Communist party speech Xiâs ambition and confidence were on display. He wants nothing less than for China to be the worldâs most important country
