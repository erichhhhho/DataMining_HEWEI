President Xi Jinping arriving for his speech at the opening of the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, Mr. Xi opened another Communist Party congress, this time as the nationâs most powerful leader in decades, all but certain to receive a second five-year term. And after spending his first term tightening control on society, he is expected to enshrine his authoritarian vision for revitalizing the party â and perhaps position himself as indispensable to its survival.
âCurrently, conditions domestically and abroad are undergoing deep and complicated changes,â Mr. Xi told some 2,300 party delegates and other dignitaries assembled in the Great Hall. âOur country is in an important period of strategic opportunity in its development,â he said in a calm, steady voice. âThe outlook is extremely bright; the challenges are also extremely grim.â
With his two most recent predecessors as Chinese leader, Mr. Hu and 91-year-old Jiang Zemin, in attendance, Mr. Xi told his audience that under him Chinese socialism was entering a ânew era.â
Since taking power in 1949, the party has reinvented itself at critical moments to survive â after Mao Zedongâs death and following the Tiananmen massacre, for example. Mr. Xi, 64, contends that it faces one of those moments now, even as it moves closer to surpassing its Soviet brethren as the longest-ruling Communist Party in history.

âParty leaders always feel peril close at hand, especially Xi, and that has not gone away,â said Deng Yuwen, a former editor with a Communist Party journal who now writes current affairs commentaries. âFor him, this hard-line, centralized style of rule is the solution and must be consolidated.â
While Mao promoted class struggle and Deng Xiaoping embraced pragmatic capitalism, Mr. Xiâs vision of the partyâs rule centers on restoring China to greatness â what he calls the âChina Dreamâ â and it draws on both the fervent dedication of Maoâs era and the glories of Chinaâs traditional culture that Mao tried to destroy.
In practice, that has meant a campaign to impose greater discipline in the partyâs ranks, and political repression outside the party, including a crackdown on activists and more stringent media censorship, including on the internet.
One big question as the congress got underway was whether Mr. Xi would try to claim an even bigger role than he already has in the nationâs future.
If he follows the script for leadership successions that his predecessors have followed since the 1990s, Mr. Xi will promote some next-generation leaders, who would be waiting in the wings for him to retire in five years.
But Mr. Xi may instead open the way for holding onto power in some form beyond his second term, breaking with the practice of his immediate predecessor.

Another would be to enable his ally and anti-corruption czar, Wang Qishan, to stay in the Standing Committee.
At age 69, Mr. Wang has exceeded the age, 68, when an informal party rule says top officials should step down once the next party congress comes around. Keeping Mr. Wang on could set a precedent for Mr. Xi to buck the same rule at the end of his second term, when he will be 69 himself.
Mr. Xi also appears likely to use this congress to mark his place in the partyâs history by inscribing his ideas, and perhaps even his name, into the partyâs constitution, giving his policies a sheen of permanence.
The weeklong congress in Beijing will be a carefully choreographed celebration of Communist rule, complete with the pageantry of goose-stepping soldiers, fluttering red hammer-and-sickle flags and the playing of âThe Internationale.â

Mr. Xiâs opening address on Wednesday morning was crafted to sound a warning that the party cannot let down its guard, said analysts and party insiders who have followed preparations.
âTreating development and security in tandem, enhancing a sense of peril, remaining vigilant in times of peace â this is a major principle of our partyâs governance of the country,â he said.
Mr. Xi has also called for renewed commitment to what he calls âreformâ and did so again in his speech to the congress. But his notion of reform is unlikely to look much like previous bouts of economic liberalization that Deng and other leaders unleashed in the 1980s and 1990s.

Back then, the party gradually embraced market forces and then full-throated capitalism, pulling back some of its power over many sectors of the economy.
Mr. Xiâs version of reform is pointed in the opposite direction: to invigorate party control. âGovernment, military, society and schools, north, south, east and west â the party is the leader of all,â he said on Wednesday.
What Mr. Xi wants to build now, Professor Pei added, is âa disciplinary state.â He continued: âIt disciplines everybody. It disciplines the party, it disciplines Chinese society. And to enforce discipline, you have to have a very powerful security state.â
More than any other recent Chinese leader, Mr. Xi has cast himself as the salvation of both party and nation. He has also been dismissive of his recent predecessors, whom he implicitly blames for failing to act forcefully enough to ensure the partyâs survival.
Beijing is rife with speculation about whether Wang Qishan, the Communist Partyâs chief corruption fighter and a close ally of Mr. Xi, will remain in the Politburo Standing Committee.
For Mr. Xi, the fall of the Soviet Union is a warning of what will go wrong if Chinaâs party succumbs to those dangers.
Mr. Xi wants to ensure that the Chinese Communist Party stays in power long after it celebrates the centenary of its founding four years from now, and long after it overtakes the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in length of time in power, a milestone that by some measures it will cross next year.
The party was beset by âlaxity and softnessâ before he took charge, Mr. Xi told the delegates on Wednesday. Now, he continued, âthe overwhelming force of the anti-corruption struggle has coalesced and is being consolidated and developed.â
He has also created a plethora of new leadership groups that allow him to control policy more directly than previous party leaders.
The major decisions to be unveiled this week were most likely made in advance by a small circle of senior party leaders.
âThe intense interest in this congress is how far Xi can and will go in reshaping the norms of Chinese politics to get his way,â Professor Fewsmith said. âEveryone has been on pins and needles because they sense that something is changing.â
