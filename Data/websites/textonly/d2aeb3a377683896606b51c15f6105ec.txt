Open letter claims imprisonment of pro-democracy activists violates international treaties, amid fears of further crackdowns on freedoms
The trio avoided jail terms last year when they were convicted of “illegal assembly” and sentenced to community service under Hong Kong’s public order ordinance. The government appealed to have the sentences reviewed, which resulted in stiffer penalties of six to eight months in prison. 
“The independence of the judiciary, a pillar of Hong Kong, risks becoming a charade, at the beck and call of the Chinese Communist party,” the letter said. 
The letter was signed by 11 prominent lawyers, including Jared Genser, attorney for Chinese Nobel peace prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, Kirsty Brimelow QC, chair of the Bar Human Rights Committee of England and Wales, and Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, former chief prosecutor in the trial of Slobodan Milošević.
The lawyers also heavily criticise the law used to jail the democracy campaigners, the public order ordinance, saying it went against the international covenant on civil and political rights. The United Nations has previously said the law places “excessive restrictions” on fundamental rights. 
The jailings represented “a serious threat to the rule of law and a breach of the principle of ‘double jeopardy’ in Hong Kong”, the letter said. 
The harsher sentences were necessary because of a “sick trend” of anti-government protests, the judge argued.
Last week 20 activists, including Wong, were convicted of criminal contempt of court in connection with the same democracy protests, although they have yet to be sentenced.
