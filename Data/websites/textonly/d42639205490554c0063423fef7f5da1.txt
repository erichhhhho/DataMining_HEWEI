What Manchu resources. Books, audiovisual foremost, but also curious about presential classes or tutors, if only for reference
Although I don't know how hard the family planning department would try to make people not violate the rules in the first place, that's how they make money so they might not have really wanted to ensure that no one ever broke the rules.
I worked with The NYT to report on a story of a woman in Beijing in the 90s who was practically forced to have an abortion. Her work unit refused to give her a permit to have a child because she applied after she was pregnant. She had the baby anyway in the end.
