Radio Free Asia, I guess you need to focus more on yourself. you are titled free, so you should speak really free. For example. Do you think it is a decent thing for a free media sponsored by CIA? 
Have you ever written a story about Israel and their regulations against Palestine?  Have you ever written a story about the Muslim Travel Bans in America?   No....I didn't think so.   The BIG difference is that China is investing HEAVILY in improving the lives of Muslim Uyghurs, where Israel and America are stealing from Muslim societies.   I know your job is to be the propaganda for the US, but at least include the truth about China and its handling of Muslim radicals.
It is true the Vietnam Communists learn everything from China. That's why China find it so difficult to make Vietnam a province of China.
Vietnam communist state learns every things from China, I wish Vietnam will be another province of China as soon as possible. But hold on a minute, Let the Montagnard Dega in Central Highlands of Vietnam alone, because  Vietnamese communist just take from us 42 years ago.
The last attack in Xinjiang was on the 18 September 2015 when 50 Han coal miners were killed in cold blood by Uighur terrorists. It has been awfully quiet ever since and hopefully more steps are taken to tighten the screw on these people. These Muslims really need to be totally subdued.
